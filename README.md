# Simplified Akinator

A simplified akinator , made to learn next.js

## Data

The data would contain fictional characters. Type of data to collect is unknown.

## Algorithm

could be done using decision trees, but for now its extremely simple: on each node: the feature that is chosen to split on is the one that would result in the most unique attributes.
this can cause issues with features that have a lot of unique values since lots of options would be displayed, so when choosing features the choice for common attributes were chosen.

## Frontend

Based on the algorithm explained above, the questions would be presented to the user.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
