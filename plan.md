## Data

The data would contain fictional characters. Type of data to collect is unknown.

## Algorithm

could be done using decision trees, but for now its extremely simple: on each node: the feature that is chosen to split on is the one that would result in the most unique attributes.
this can cause issues with features that have a lot of unique values since lots of options would be displayed, so when choosing features the choice for common attributes were chosen.

## Frontend

Based on the algorithm explained above, the questions would be presented to the user.
